Hi everyone! Welcome to my first ecommerce web application repository.
Here I have been developing all the features of my ecommerce which started as a project of a REST API for the course "Backend programming with Node Js" at CoderHouse.
Trought the last weeks I have been adding more features as a Frontend made using React and Redux and an Admin Dashboard also built up with React & Redux, and it has also a cloud storage made with Firebase where the admin can upload the products images.

--Next steps:

1. Add a functional payment way using paypal api
2. Add a functional payment way using MercadoPago
3. Finish styles

Thank you for reading!
